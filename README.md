# RC-and-RL-Phase-Shifter
In this project, a circuit is designed using RC circuit or RL circuit and use it to shift the phase, that can either be leading or lagging inside particular range.
A phase shifter is a device that changes the phase of an input signal by a predetermined amount.
It can shift the phase of an input signal by a few degrees w.r.t output.
The phase shift depends upon values of RL or RC.
